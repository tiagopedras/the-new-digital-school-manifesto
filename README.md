The New Digital Design School
=============================

A student-centered new school based on web and digital design that intends to be open sourced thanks to and for the community.

**Caveat lector**
This is a work in progress (both the document and the project itself) and it cannot ever get better without feedback. Feel free to suggest changes and additions or contact me directly via twitter (@tiagopedras).


## What it is
* A new approach to the educational system of most countries.
* A more open, more flexible, student-centered way of learning.
* An institution that focuses more on allowing the student to learn what he wants, the way he wants, rather than teaching formatted sets of knowledge.
* A hub for the community to expand, grow and prosper alongside with the industry itself

## What it’s not
* The ordinary school.
	** Students are guided by teachers, mentors, industry leaders but in the end they have the final word.
	** Evaluation is done by pears and, even more important, by the student himself, based on he believes is the best path for a career and on how prepared he feels for it.
	** The community will always input their opinion and needs onto the learning system.
* Something confined to 4 walls.
	** This model is meant to be replicable anywhere in the world thanks to it’s openness and freeform.

## Objectives
* To create a more suited place to learn how to be a digital designer. One that reflects the multitude of areas and skills, the fast and constant pace of evolution of the area, as well as the community's way of being. One that isn’t written in stone and is suited to be adjusted by each individual, and therefore is not validatable by the old evaluation systems.
* To promote knowledge and skill learning that is both suited for the student’s tastes as well as for the industry’s needs. By involving the industry soon in the education timeline in order to avoid out-of-date knowledge and useless skill sets, as well as to create networking with students to promote early job opportunities.

## Key players
* Students (specific document soon)
* Industry (specific document soon)
* Community

## Key activities
5 teaching pillars or key activities: classes, workshops, mentoring, conferences and projects. These will have different relevancy percentages throughout the school year.
* Classes will establish the broad foundations that everyone should know
* Workshops will be a way to specialise in certain very specific topics
* Mentoring is the ideal way for students to acquire soft skills that are usually obtained through experience. There should be seasonal mentoring and permanent mentoring (staff)
* Conferences are going to solidify a web creator's personality traits and share the most up-to-date topics
* Projects may or not be suggested by companies. May or not be group projects. May or not have a final product. They intend to teach through experience and through being in touch with the users and the industry
